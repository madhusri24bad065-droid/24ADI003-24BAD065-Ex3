Scenario 1: Multilinear Regression – Student Performance Prediction
            In this scenario, a Multilinear Regression model is used to predict student academic performance using the Students Performance in Exams dataset from Kaggle. The final exam score is calculated as the average of math, reading, and writing scores, and features such as study hours, attendance, parental education, test preparation, and sleep hours are used as inputs. The data is preprocessed through encoding, missing value handling, and feature scaling. The model is trained and evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² score, and optimization techniques like feature elimination and Ridge and Lasso regularization are applied to improve performance.

 Scenario 2: Polynomial Regression – Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction
             In this scenario, a Polynomial Regression model is implemented to predict vehicle fuel efficiency using the Auto MPG dataset from Kaggle. Horsepower is used as the main input feature, and polynomial features of degrees 2, 3, and 4 are generated to capture non-linear relationships. The dataset is cleaned, scaled, and split into training and testing sets. The models are evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² score, and Ridge regression is applied to control overfitting and improve accuracy.
